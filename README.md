Coding exam for LaunchByte/Ambi

Problem: Given two filenames, open and read their contents line-by- line, processing each
line in parallel to replace any double-quoted string that appears on a single
line with its reversed value.
Both files should be processed at the same time, operating on as many lines

as are feasible without exhausting the stack.
So if a file contains a line like:
Now it the time for &quot;all good men&quot; to come to the aid of their country.
The resulting line should read:
Now it the time for &quot;nem doog lla&quot; to come to the aid of their country.
You must provide your own data files with at least 100 lines where at least half
of the lines include a double-quoted string.
